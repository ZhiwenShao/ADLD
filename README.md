# ADLD
This repository implements the training and testing of ADLD for [Weakly-Supervised Unconstrained Action Unit Detection via Latent Feature Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10143.pdf). The repository offers the implementation of the paper in PyTorch.

# Getting Started
## Installation
This code was tested with PyTorch 0.4.0 and Python 2.7.

## Datasets

Put [BP4D](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~lijun/Research/3DFE/3DFE_Analysis.html) and [EmotioNet](http://cbcsl.ece.ohio-state.edu/dbform_emotionet.html) into the folder "dataset" following the paths shown in the list files of the folder "data/list".

## Preprocessing
- Prepare the training data


Format of the outputFile: 5 facial landmark locations (x1,y1,x2,y2...).
